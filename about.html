                <h3>Where are you based?</h3>
                <p>I currently live in Virginia.</p>
                <h3>How do you spend your free time?</h3>
                <p>
                  I love spending time outdoors with family - hiking, kayaking
                  and exploring different parks. I also enjoy caring for my
                  indoor plants, playing games, and having fun with friends.
                </p>
                <h3>What’s a fun fact about you?</h3>
                <p>
                  I used to help with wildlife rehabilitation and also
                  volunteered at the zoo. Learning how to care for all the
                  different species was amazing. The best part was getting to
                  pet rhinos and getting to see their different personalities.
                </p>
                <h3>What’s your professional experience?</h3>
                <p>
                  While earning my BS in Graphic Design, the classes I enjoyed
                  the most were psychology based — recognizing how design affects
                  human thoughts and feelings amazed me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After college, I started as an intern with the Society of
                  Automotive Engineers and worked my way up to be the Aerospace
                  Team with three direct reports. I managed all the projects
                  that came through for our team. One of the projects was the
                  bimonthly Aerospace Engineering magazine. When my husband
                  needed to move for his job, they put me under contract to
                  remotely manage and produce the magazine while working with
                  the editor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once in Virginia, this gave me a opportunity to start my own
                  business and Wolfe Design Studio was established. The business
                  was built through networking and referrals. I've had many
                  clients for over 10 years each. As a freelancer, I got to work
                  on numerous types of design projects. I helped companies
                  establish and grow their branding with marketing communication
                  pieces and website design. I've also had the privilege to work
                  with many marketing consultants, writers, and web developers
                  to offer complete agency packages. The favorite part of what I
                  do is having the opportunity to work with a variety of
                  industries and businesses, but mostly getting to help a
                  diverse group of owners grow their businesses to the next
                  level.
                </p>

                <!--  <p>I've coordinated hundreds of projects between multiple clients and industries. In addition to collaborating with clients, client teams, sub-contractors, and vendors, as well as designing, I've always managed to meet tight deadlines. Because of this, I feel product management would be a natural fit and next step. Knowing the end-to-end process is essential. Getting to work with the stakeholders and hearing the strategy and limitations behind the project sets the foundation for the next step. Understanding the end user and researching what works best for them helps in designing experiences that they enjoy. Knowing how to test features and establish visual consistency also creates an end product that the user is happy with. Understanding how to communicate with product developers is key to help it all come together.</p>
