        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Are you struggling to find an easy-to-comprehend weather app that
          focuses on weather information that is important to you and your
          preferred water sport?
        </p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          Reviewed project brief, business requirements, design criteria, and
          hypothesized user stories and job stories Researched user needs
          including a competitive analysis, in-person interviews, and surveys
          Created user flows for 3 core features and established 3 personas
          Used the iterative process by testing features, card sorting, remote
          user testing, preference testing, team feedback, established design
          guidelines and updated prototypes based on the feedback received
          Once it was presented and approved, assets were gathered for hand
          off to the developers, with consideration to future iterations and
          lessons learned
        </p>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>

        <!--section 1-->
        <h1>1. Initial Hypothesis</h1>
        <p>
          PROBLEM: Most weather apps have a lot of extra information that the
          typical user doesn’t need. The apps don’t focus on what is important
          to the user for their particular water sport or how the weather
          affects the waterways.<br>
          HYPOTHESIS: We believe that by seeing a clean simple dashboard that
          focuses on the weather that is important to the user, it will
          capture the user’s interest.<br>
          INITIAL PROBLEM STATEMENT: Visiting water sport enthusiasts need a
          way to easily comprehend the local weather and how it affects
          various local waterways because they are only here for a short time
          and want feedback and referrals from the locals. We will know this
          to be true when we see engagement on the app.
        </p>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>
          (1 EXAMPLE FROM 10 CREATED)<br><br>

          FEATURE: Location and Ability To Share<br>
          As an excursion planner, I want to see the location and temperatures
          immediately so that I can plan my water activities and share them
          with my group.
        </p>

        <!--section 2-->
        <h1>2. Research and Results</h1>
        <p>
          After creating the User Stories and Job Stories, a Competitive
          Analysis of 3 weather apps (1Weather, Tide Guide, and WeatherBug)
          was done to gather information needed to create the interview
          questions.
        </p>

        <h2>In-person Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          (16 QUESTIONS; 3 PARTICIPANTS)<br><br>

          GOALS:<br>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Documenting user opinions on competing sites or apps that inform
            the design of the project
          </li>
          <li>
            Determining which apps or sites your users enjoy using, as well as
            what types of apps or sites leave them frustrated
          </li>
          <li>
            Discerning the types of tasks users perform and in what contexts
          </li>
        </ul>

        SUMMARY:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All three seemed to want something that was clean and simple to
            use with little to no navigation
          </li>
          <li>
            They were very unhappy with ads but didn’t want to pay for a
            weather app
          </li>
          <li>Inaccurate reports were also a point of friction</li>
          <li>
            The UV index and air quality weren’t much of a concern for anyone
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!--insert quote box here - based on viewport?-->
        <h5>"Give me a one-stop shop!"</h5>
        <h6>- User Participant</h6>

        <p>
          !!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: Most weather apps contain ads and it was
          the number one complaint. I should have reworded one of the
          questions to “Besides ads, what would be the biggest friction
          point?” Then I would have received more data on the friction points.
        </p>

        <!--section 3-->
        <h1>3. User Flows and Personas</h1>
        <p>
          From the research above, I analyzed the information using Affinity
          Mapping and an Empathy Map Canvas. From those emerging themes, I
          gathered features and pain points that were important to the users’
          experiences.
        </p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>
          From the above insights, 3 personas were created:<br><br>

          I love the outdoors and speading time on the water, but not
          necessarily in it. - Christine the Chillin' Chick
        </p>

        <p>
          !!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: Although this was my favorite part of
          the process, it did present a challenge when trying to come up with
          the right questions for the interviews. Having limited experience
          with what the process would entail after the interview, I wasn’t
          sure what I would be doing with the information gathered. The saying
          “trust the process” was quite accurate in this case as I realized
          all the necessary information to create the personas was in the
          feedback.
        </p>

        <!--section 4-->
        <h1>4. Iterative Process</h1>
        <p>
          After the Task Analysis and User Flows for each persona were
          established, a mobile-first design was approached. I created the
          main navigation for the mobile app and desktop. Card Sorting helped
          to validate or update my choices.
        </p>

        <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
        <p>
          (20 CARDS; 7 PARTICIPANTS; OPTIMAL WORKSHOP)<br><br>

          GOAL:<br>
          The initial Site Map was set up and refined with Card Sorting (open
          sort)<br>
          <br>
          SUMMARY:<br>
          The Similarity Matrix validated what to update in my Site Map:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Changed “Rentals” to “Things to Do”</li>
          <li>Changed “Air Temps” to “Weather”</li>
          <li>Added “Account” to “Settings”</li>
          <li>Added “Share Location”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          !!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: Doing an open sort was confusing to most
          of the participants on how to do it. I should have used a close
          sort. And they were having issues viewing all the cards on their
          devices. I relied on the Similarity Matrix (85s and 100s) for the
          new data.
        </p>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
          (3 TASK FLOWS; 7 PARTICIPANTS)<br><br>
          With Neilsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics and Rapid Prototyping in
          mind, low and mid-fidelity prototypes were established and now it
          was time for testing! I set up a recruitment plan and script. Seven
          participants preformed three task flows via Zoom with Figma
          wireframes.
        </p>

        GOALS:<br>
        To validate the ease of use for the 3 core features: Custom Home
        Screen, Safety, and Things To Do<br>

        <ul>
          <li>Can the user navigate the “things to do” section?</li>
          <li>Can the user find “safety” information easily?</li>
          <li>Create a custom home screen through “settings”</li>
          <li>Gather metrics for Errors and Satisfaction</li>
        </ul>

        <p>SUMMARY:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After organizing an Affinity Map I transferred the patterns to the
            Rainbow Spread Sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            With these 3 items in mind: Goals from Test Plan, Main
            Features/Functions Needed, and Business Needs, I focused on
            solutions for major errors as well as future iterations.

        <h2>Preference Test</h2>
        <p>(2 HOME SCREENS; 15 PARTICIPANTS; USABILITYHUB)</p>
        <br><br>

        GOALS:<br>
        <p>
          Since the weather card customization was a main feature of the app,
          I wanted to see which card layout/design the users preferred.
        </p>

        SUMMARY:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Test results were “not statistically significant”--v1 won by one
            vote
          </li>
          <li>HOWEVER, 4 out of 5 in the U.S. chose v2</li>
          <li>
            This app is targeting the Virginia area, so for that reason, I
            agreed with v2
          </li>
          <li>
            And my original design reasoning also aligned with more people
            that voted on v2
          </li>

          immediately the data that is most important. - User Participant

        <p>
          !!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: I was concerned when I saw the results
          were “not statistically significant”. I wasn’t sure if I should test
          again or not. But after further review of the data, I found the
          differences between the U.S. choices compared to the other countries
          which helped validate the results.

        GOALS:<br>
        To create design guidelines for future teams to make changes without
        loosing the branded look of the interface. SUMMARY:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Colors from the ocean were used throughout</li>
          <li>Roboto Flex font was used for it’s simplicity</li>
          <li>UI and icons were chosen for their simplicity as well</li>
          <li>Imagery was chosen to express fun and excitement</li>
          <li>
            Accessibility plugins were run to check for color contrast and
            text size issues
          </li>
          <li>
            Further iterations were made to the prototypes to make everything

          !!! CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED: When reviewing the Layout Anatomy from
          the Material Design Guidelines under the recommended grid behavior
          for device breakpoints, there seemed to be inconsistent information
          so I wasn’t clear on which to choose. Accessibility tests and grids
          were introduced toward the end and I feel it would have been more
          efficient to use these at the beginning of the process.

        ORIGINAL GOAL:<br>
        <p>
          To create a simple weather app that provides water sport enthusiasts
          an easy way to plan their day on the water.
        </p>

        SUMMARY:<br>
        <p>
          My solution was a simple source of weather information that helps
          user decide when and where is the best time to enjoy their water
          activities.

        FUTURE ITERATIONS:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I would like to add a comments section for users to add area
            information and photos.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the home screen, the other main buttons is “View Waterways”.
            Due to time constraints, this task flow did not get attention but
            it would add value for the user to see the maps and plan a route.
          </li>
        </ul>

        LESSONS LEARNED:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I enjoyed the research part of the process the most! I loved the
            Affinity Mapping and seeing what emerged with the first sort and
            then sorting it differently to create a different viewpoint and
            outcome.
          </li>
          <li>
            I really did empathize with the users and their pain points while
            keeping in mind I was not the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve realized that how I ask the question has a direct impact on
            what data will be created.
          </li>
          <li>
            Various feedback from the users added more value to the iterations
            of the prototypes thus creating a better product—yet still, plenty
            of room for improvement! I’ve realized products are never
            complete.
          </li>
